## Why

 Created this template primarily for my work, to prevent from constantly reinventing the wheel when starting a new project.
 Often had ideas and then delayed because the pain of starting from scratch is too high. This toolkit hopefully helps to reduce the friction.

This template repo comes with the following tools:

- [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) monorepo.
- [`preconstruct`](https://preconstruct.tools/) - Automated builds and great support for JS tooling.
- [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For typesafe code, great editor support and simpler refactoring.
- [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) - for code linting.
- [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) - for code formatting.
- [`babel`](https://babeljs.io/) - used by preconstruct for the compilation of code and macros.
- [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/) - for automating releases to GitHub and NPM.
- [`GitHub Actions`](https://github.com/features/actions) - as the primary continuous integration (deployment) tool.

- [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - for git hooks.
- [`lint-staged`](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) - for automated precommit checks.

## Versioning

## Supported Node.js Versions

Libraries in this ecosystem make a best effort to track
[Node.js’ release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). Here’s [a
post on why we think this is important](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/maintainers-should-consider-following-node-js-release-schedule-ab08ed4de71a).
